# Library Management System

## Project Description
A comprehensive library management system that handles book cataloging, search functionality, and rating management. The system provides tools for librarians to maintain book records and for users to search the catalog and rate books.

## Team Members and Roles
> **Note:** Please update this section with your actual team member information

- **Team Member 1** - Backend Development (Book catalog management)
- **Team Member 2** - Search & Retrieval Features
- **Team Member 3** - Rating System & Analytics
- **Team Member 4** - Testing & Documentation

## Domain Focus and Problem Statement

**Domain:** Library and Information Management

### Problem Statement
Libraries need an efficient way to manage their book collections, enable users to search for books, and gather feedback through ratings. Traditional paper-based systems are inefficient and prone to errors. This system provides a digital solution for:

- Maintaining an organized book catalog with metadata (title, author, year, ISBN)
- Quick search functionality by title or author
- Book rating collection and analysis
- Integration with analytics for data-driven decisions

## Installation and Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install pandas
```

3. **Verify installation:**
```bash
python --version
# Should show Python 3.7+
```

4. **Run the program:**
```bash
python library_system.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding Books to Catalog
```python
# Add a new book with title, author, year, and ISBN
add_book("The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 1937, "978-0-345-33968-3")
add_book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949, "978-0-452-28423-4")
```

### Displaying All Books
```python
# Show all books in the catalog
display_books()
```

### Searching for Books
```python
# Search by author or title (case-insensitive)
results = search_books("tolkien")
print(results)
# Output: [{'title': 'The Hobbit', 'author': 'J.R.R. Tolkien', 'year': 1937, 'isbn': '978-0-345-33968-3'}]
```

### Retrieving a Specific Book
```python
# Get book by ISBN
book = get_book("978-0-452-28423-4")
print(book)
# Output: {'title': '1984', 'author': 'George Orwell', 'year': 1949, 'isbn': '978-0-452-28423-4'}
```

### Rating Books
```python
# Interactive rating system
rate_book(library)
# User will be prompted to select a book and provide a rating (1-5)

# Display all ratings
show_ratings(library)
```

### Movie Analytics (Bonus Feature)
```python
# Analyze movie ratings by genre
analyze_movies()
# Shows average ratings grouped by genre
```

## Function Library Overview

### Core Book Management (`books` list)

| Function | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `add_book()` | title, author, year, isbn | None | Adds a new book to the catalog |
| `display_books()` | None | None | Prints all books in the catalog |
| `search_books()` | query (str) | list | Searches books by title or author |
| `get_book()` | isbn (str) | dict or None | Retrieves a specific book by ISBN |
| `delete_book()` | book_id | bool | Removes a book from catalog (Note: uses 'id' field not currently in books) |

### Rating Management (`library` list)

| Function | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `rate_book()` | library (list) | None | Interactive function to rate books |
| `show_ratings()` | library (list) | None | Displays all books with their ratings |

### Analytics Module

| Function | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `analyze_movies()` | None | None | Analyzes movie ratings by genre using pandas |

## Known Issues and Improvements Needed

1. **Bug in `delete_book()`**: Function references `book["id"]` field, but books only have `isbn` field
2. **Data Persistence**: Books are stored in memory only; consider adding file/database storage
3. **Separate Data Structures**: The `books` list and `library` list are separate; should be unified
4. **Input Validation**: Limited error handling in user input functions

## Contribution Guidelines

### For Team Members
