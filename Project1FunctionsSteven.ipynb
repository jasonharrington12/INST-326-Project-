## Here's a revised peer review with a bullet point for each function:

## Peer Review - Jason Harrington 
## These are really good def functions we can use for out project. Your code is well-structured and handles edge cases thoughtfully. Here are my observations for each function:
## Function-by-Function Review:

## get_highest_rated(library) - Clean implementation that correctly finds the max rating and handles ties. The two-step filtering approach is easy to follow. Consider returning the data instead of printing directly for better reusability.
## get_unrated_books(library) - Straightforward logic with helpful output. The count in the header is a nice touch. Could be simplified using a list comprehension: unrated = [book for book in library if book["rating"] is None]
## get_highest_rated_movie(movies) - This is essentially identical to get_highest_rated(library) except for variable names. These could be combined into a single generic get_highest_rated_items(items, item_type) function to eliminate duplication.
## get_unrated_movies(movies) - Same structure as get_unrated_books. Again, these book/movie pairs could share a single implementation with a parameter for the item type.
## get_top_users(users) - This is the most sophisticated function and it's very well done! Excellent handling of ties with the rank logic, good use of .get() for safe dictionary access, and the summary statistics are a nice addition. The sorting with lambda works perfectly (good call getting help with this—it's worth understanding as you'll use it often).
