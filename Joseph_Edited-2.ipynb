## Function-by-Function Review
# calculate_late_fee(days_late, fee_per_day=0.25)

# Good input validation for negative values, but consider raising a ValueError instead of returning a string to maintain consistent return types and make error handling easier for calling code.

find_books_by_genre(genre, book_list)

# Excellent use of list comprehension and case-insensitive matching, though you should add validation to check if books have a 'genre' key and handle cases where genre might be None to prevent potential errors.

find_book_by_isbn(isbn, book_list)

# Simple and clear logic, but returning a string for "not found" is inconsistent with other error handling approaches—consider returning None or raising an exception instead.

check_out_book(book_title, user_name)

# Clean function with an informative return message, but it doesn't verify if the book exists or is already checked out—consider adding validation or state tracking.

return_book(book_title, user_name)

# Consistent structure with check_out_book(), but similarly lacks verification that the book was actually checked out by this user before allowing the return.


# Overall: Great foundation with clean, readable code! Focus on making error handling more consistent across functions and adding validation for edge cases.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
